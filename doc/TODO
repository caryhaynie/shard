Shard TODO:


1. Update global descriptor table to create code / data segments for all 4
 ring levels. Current privledge model as follows:
   Ring 0 -- kernel
   Ring 1 -- Core system components &  drivers.
   Ring 2 -- non-core system components & drivers.
   Ring 3 -- Userspace.

"Core system components & drivers" is defined as the applications that considered
to be part of the base shard platform. 

1.5. Write real documentation and steps so that other people can build and
run the system in a test environment.

2. Start working on fleshing out an ABI, API, etc. Currently, the plan is to adhere
to the L4 api for the kernel as much as possible, and build upon that.

3. Add support for booting from an ext 2/3 disk ( is it easier to build an ext3
boot image than a fat32 one? )

4. Start pondering a real feature list, a real roadmap, and a real timeline.

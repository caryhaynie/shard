Shard TODO:

1.25. Migrate as much nasm assembly as possible to GCC inline assembly.
      Start moving toward phasing nasm out of the toolchain in favor of
      the holy trinity of gcc, as, and ld.

1.5. Write real documentation and steps so that other people can build and
run the system in a test environment.

  a. Migrate from a FAT 32 based boot image to an ext 2 based one. Integrate it
  into the build system so that people can build boot images using the Makefile.

1.75. Add support for booting from an ext 2/3 disk ( is it easier to build an ext3
boot image than a fat32 one? )

2. Start working on fleshing out an ABI, API, etc. Currently, the plan is to adhere
to the L4 api for the kernel as much as possible, and build upon that.

  a. L4 puts IPC in the kernel and moves everything else out to user space.  A
  large portion of the 'system library' is going to consist of wrapping ipc
  calls to the various system components and making them easy to take 
  advantage of.
  b. Another issue whose time for consideration has come is what sort of experience
  will be provided to developers of applications.


4. Start pondering a real feature list, a real roadmap, and a real timeline.
